# Azure Powered AI Freezer Monitor

The Azure Powered AI Freezer Monitor is a maker hardware based IoT monitor that uses machine learning, or ML, to provide early warnings of potential equipment failure. This guide covers building the device, collecting training data, setting up email alerts, training a custom auto encoder machine learning model, and deploying the model to an ESP32 development board. 

The project is designed to be functional for low temperature scientific freezers (-60 C), with the goal of reducing  catastrophic failure and the need to keep backup freezers running full-time. However, please note that this project is primarily for demonstrative and educational purposes and has not gone through extensive testing. 

>This project takes about one hour to fully complete.

1. Select the *Send an email* action
    > *Note: This will be a little different depending on which email client you use*
1. Log in with your email account
1. Customize your message, this email will be sent any time an anomaly is detected.

#### Set up IoT Device
1. Next you'll need to get the connection string for you device, navigate to the IoT Hub you created earlier
1. In the left navigation select *IoT devices*
1. At the top left of the page select *+ New*
1. Give the device an ID
    ![IoT hub device creation](./media/new_iot_device.png)
1. Press *Save* at the bottom of the screen
1. Select the device you created
1. Copy the *Primary Connection String* you'll use this string in the next section

1. Finally upload your code to your Feather board, open the command palette and type in **Arduino: Upload**

## Cost

While an Azure account is free, using resources will incur a cost. Some of the resources offer a free version, we've compiled an estimate costs to run this project per month. If your account is new you should receive a $200 credit which should cover about five and a half years of these services.

| Resource | Free Tier | Cost |
|----------|-----------|------|
| IoT Hub  | Yes | $0 |
| Azure Functions | Yes | $0 |
| Azure Table Storage | No | $1 |
| Anomaly detection cognitive service | Yes | $0 |
| Logic Apps | No | $1 |
| **Total** || **~$2** |

### Azure Budgets

It's a good idea to also set up a budget for resource group (don't worry if you don't know what all these terms mean yet, we'll explain everything as we go). An Azure budget will send you email warning you that you've reached the amount specified. It won't turn off your services, so you will still have to log in and turn off any service you no longer want to be charged for. We've included a budget set at $5/mo as part of the Azure template, but if you want to learn more about costs on Azure, [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis) is a good starting place.

## Azure Resources

Resources are what tools and services on Azure are called. You'll use a variety of resources for this project. Some of them for compute, some for storage, others are hubs that act as connectors. Below is a list of the resources used in this project and links to where you can learn more about them.

| Resource | Description|
|----------|-----------|
| [IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/)| Managed service for bidirectional communication between IoT devices and Azure
| [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) | Event-driven serverless compute platform |
| [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/) | NoSQL key-value store |
| [Anomaly detection cognitive service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/) | An AI service that helps you foresee problems before they occur |
| [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/) | No code platform for integration solutions |


## <a name="message-spec"></a> Message Specification

The message sent from your device should be a JSON formatted string and needs to include a device id as a string and the temperature reading as a float. You should send exactly 1 data point per minute.

```json
{"deviceId":"ESP32_device", "temperature": 25.235}
```

The anomaly detection service expected message to be evenly timed. Using a delay or an internal counter on the device is not sufficient, we recommend using an NTP server to synchronize the time the messages are sent.
